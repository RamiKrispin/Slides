# Any experince with time series analysis? forecast and plotly packages?

class: inverse

## Introduction

The **TSstudio** package provides a set of functions for time series analysis and forecasting such as:

- Utility functions for pre-processing time series data
- Interactive data visualization tools for descriptive analysis, based on the **plotly** package engine
- Set of functions for predictive analysis and forecasting automation with the use of models from the **forecast**, **forecastHybrid**, and **bsts** packages

The primary goal of the package is to simplify the analysis workflow (or, minimum code - maximum results)

## Package structure

class: inverse

# Installation

Install from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TSstudio/index.html):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("TSstudio")
```

Or from [Github](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/TSstudio):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/TSstudio")
```


---
class: inverse

# Utility functions

The `ts_info` returns the main characteristics of the series:

```{r}
library(TSstudio)
data("USVSales")
ts_info(USgas)

data("Michigan_CS")
ts_info(Michigan_CS)
```

---
class: inverse

# Utility functions

The `ts_split` splits a time series object to a training and testing partitions:

```{r}
USgas_split <- ts_split(USgas, sample.out = 12)

train <- USgas_split$train
test <- USgas_split$test


```

---
class: inverse
# Utility functions

The `ts_split` splits a time series object to a training and testing partitions:

```{r}
ts_info(train)
ts_info(test)
```


---
class: inverse

# Utility functions

The `ts_to_prophet` convert time series object (e.g., `ts`, `xts`, `zoo`) to `prophet` input structure:

```{r}
USgas_prophet <- ts_to_prophet(USgas)

head(USgas_prophet)
```

---
class: inverse

# Utility functions

Another useful utility functions:

- `xts_to_ts()` for converting `xts` object to `ts` object
- `zoo_to_ts()` for converting `zoo` object to `ts` object
- `ts_sum()` - summation of multiple time series objects
- `ts_reshape()` - transform time series object to a data frame format

---
class: inverse

# Visualization tools

The `ts_plot` function plot time series objects, supporting multiple formats (i.e., `ts`, `xts`, `zoo`, `data.frame`, `tbl`):

```{r}
ts_plot(USgas)
```

---
class: inverse

# Visualization tools

It is fairly simple to customize the plot:

```{r}
ts_plot(USgas, Ytitle = "Billion Cubic Feet", 
        title = "Monthly Natural Gas Consumption in the US",
        slider = TRUE, color = "green") 

```

---
class: inverse

# Visualization tools

All the visualization outputs are `plotly` objects:

```{r}
p <- ts_plot(USgas, Ytitle = "Billion Cubic Feet", 
        title = "Monthly Natural Gas Consumption in the US")
class(p)
```

---
class: inverse

# Visualization tools

Therefore, you can apply any of the plotly functions, and customize the object accordingly:

```{r}
library(plotly)
p %>% layout(font = list(color = "white"),
       plot_bgcolor = "black", paper_bgcolor = "black")
```

---
class: inverse

# Seasonal analysis

The package provides a set of functions for seasonal analysis, such as:

- `ts_seasonal()` - provides a view of the series by its frequency units, applicable for a series with daily frequency and above (e.g., monthly, quarterly)
- `ts_heatmap()` - heatmap for time series data supports time series with half hour frequency and above
- `ts_surface` - A 3D view of the series, by the frequency units (e.g., the month of the year), the cycle units (e.g. the year), and the series values
- `ts_polar` - polar plot of time series data, applicable for monthly or quarterly series
- `ts_quantile` - quantile plots of time series data
